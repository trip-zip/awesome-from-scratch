# Awesome From Scratch

## What's the plan?
It's been a while since I've looked at my awesomeWM config.  I want to improve some things, and I think there's value in starting completely from scratch and being deliberate about what functionality I add and what "fluff" I leave out.  I think it might be fun or interesting to do a series of videos "from scratch" explaining my choices, trade-offs, and all the while, documenting my colossal ignorance for future generations.
I want to help demystify some of the magic of Awesome and hopefully add another resource to the list that can help make awesome more approachable.
The plan is to start with a default config, and then add functionality and polish over time.  I'll try to keep the commits small and focused so that it's easy to follow along.

## Why awesome?
* It has a reputation of being "intimidating", but really it doesn't have to be.
* The [API documentation](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/) is fantastic, BUT, it's often geared towards developers which can contribute to the intimidation factor.
* It's insanely configurable, fast, extensible. Even right out of the box it's highly useable.
* If you're just looking to get work done, honestly, double check the keybindings close this tab, and get to work.  It works really nice right out of the box.

## Project goals
1. Start from scratch, use the config and find real pain points, and make a wish list of things to add/improve.  Solve my issues as they come up.
2. Focus on deep understanding.  Explore the docs, try to utilize at least something in each library and paradigm.
3. Use ONLY awesome's built in tools
  * As long as such tools exist.  (I'm going to use brightnessctl for screen brightness, for example)
  * No Rofi, polybar, conky, etc.  Let's showcase what awesome has to offer
4. Make it modestly pretty. (I'm not that creative...)

 
## GET STARTED
I'll make branches for each logical grouping of changes so it's easy to see the steps I'm taking in the progression.
I probably won't always catalogue every single line I change in the readmes, but hopefully the code will be easy to parse and see what I changed.
